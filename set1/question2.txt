Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to 
the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 
4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) 
based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the average rental duration(in the number of days) for movies across
all categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.
