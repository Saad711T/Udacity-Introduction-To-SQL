Question 2:
We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers,
how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, and what was the amount of the monthly payments.
Can you write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for
each month by these top 10 paying customers?
